# send_news
Sends 3 messages regarding stock market values form the 2 previous days (not counting the actual day).
I used Twilio, but you can use any other alternative, for example:
Alertzy (https://alertzy.app/). A mobile app and an API to talk to. And 100 free push messages per day.
Pushover (https://pushover.net/). Also a mobile app and an API but the mobile app is a paid one. Once you have that you can send 10000 messages per month.
PushBullet (https://www.pushbullet.com/). Can do much more than just send messages so might be a bit overwhelming but it also has a browser plugin to send messages to if you don't want to use your phone.
Telegram (https://telegram.org/). You can create a telegram bot to send you messages... I'm not sure at what point in the course you are but this is definitely not beginner level stuff..

Change the code accordingly depending on the cloud communications platform.
